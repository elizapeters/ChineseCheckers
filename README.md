Chinese checkers

Currently, the game is set up so the user can play the game against our ai agents.
In order to replicate our tests you should uncomment out the bottom part of our code and uncomment line 69 in the gui.py file comment out line 70, uncomment line 89 and comment out line 90. We did not seed our tests unfortunately so you may not get our exact values, but we included a seed in the submission if you want to replicate your results. The randomness comes from shuffling the moves and because some of the values of moves are the same this impacts the game.
